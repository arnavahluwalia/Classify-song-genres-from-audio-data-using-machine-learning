# Classify-song-genres-from-audio-data

Topic : Machine Learning
Programming language : Python
Algorithms used : Principal Component Analysis, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees

We examine data compiled by a research group known as The Echo Nest. Our goal is to look through this dataset and classify songs as being either 'Hip-Hop' or 'Rock' - all without listening to a single one ourselves. In doing so, we will learn how to clean our data, do some exploratory data visualization, and use feature reduction towards the goal of feeding our data through some simple machine learning algorithms, such as decision trees and logistic regression.
